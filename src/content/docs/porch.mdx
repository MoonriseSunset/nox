This page is a place where I put cool links and buttons which lead to outside sites (outside my lil slice of the internet), hence it being the front porch, open to the outside world.

## Friend's Sites

<h3>The Radish Realm</h3>

Cool site made by my good friend Saarol. Oh and he made this convenient lil button to use:

<h3>Oasis</h3>

A brand site made by my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/creeperlulu">Epson</a>. He designed and built all of the site, including the graphics, big kudos to him.
