## Yo!

I'm Moonrise, you can call me Moon too.

I'm a neurodivergent uni student who enjoys coding, and 3D design/printing :3

When I'm not coding or designing, you can often find me on Minecraft or Kerbal Space Program, or [tending to my succulents](https://moonrisesunset.github.io/home/greenhouse/).

I became a furry around the pandemic (how original), and ever since I've pretty much just hung out with various small groups of furs. not sure what else to put here but yea lol.
